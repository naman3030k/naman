# Naman
*Naman* is a CSS Framework based on Classical UI Concept.

__*Classical UI Concept* :__
The classical ui concept refers to the old look (the simplest ones) of web pages that prevail in old sites like __sitewizard.com__ & __yourhtmlsource.com__ for instance.

##Feel free to use it
Based on the old look or what I call the classical ui concept, you can use Naman CSS Framework to build your own websites with simple, mobile responsive, and beautiful webpages __*much faster & lighter than bootstrap*__ for free.
